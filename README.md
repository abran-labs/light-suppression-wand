## Usage
1. Hold a **golden hoe**
2. **Shift+right-click** a light-emitting block.
3. The block's light is suppressed — the block stays but emits no light
4. **Shift+right-click** again to restore the light

## Features
- Works with any light-emitting block.
- Suppression persists across server restarts.
- Automatic cleanup when suppressed blocks are removed by any means (player breaking, block updates, explosions, pistons, etc.)
- Compatible with [ScalableLux](https://modrinth.com/mod/scalablelux)
